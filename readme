''' THIS IS COMPLETE GUIDE FOR THE PROJECT AND ITS DETAILS '''

*******************************
PROJECT GUIDELINES
*******************************
1.  keep all the column names of database consistent..
    Wwe have kept small letters for everything

    comp_attribute              ==>>  for Component model
    std_attribute               ==>>  for Student model
    std_issue_                  ==>>  for StudentIssueLog model
    del_std_                    ==>>  for DeletedStudent model
    del_std_issue_              ==>>  for DeletedStudentIssueLog model


*******************************
MISTAKES THAT I HAVE DONE
*******************************

1.  we didn't used Django--User model as it was slow(it may be due to our
    wrong code but it was)
    and we don't accept our product to be SLOW....
    I TRIED AFTER MAKING PROTOTYPE OF OUR PROJECT (which was a very bad
    decision costing me 2 days
    and i have to SHIFT BACK TO ORIGINAL PROTOTYPE)

2.  you don't need to do {% load static %} every page you extend....
    just make global js,css,html besides base_layout and  add extra blocks
    for every new css/js file.


3.  keep DEBUG == TRUE in development and
         DEBUG == False in production as u don't want users to see errors

4.  ***IMP****
    Earlier i have put the business logic in VIEWS.PY file..
    now we have added all business logic in MODELS.PY

5.)


*********************************
THINGS I LEARNT NEW BESIDES ""DJANGO""
*********************************
1.  to refer things in different apps you write like this
    "from ..student_dash.urls import app_name"          .. means 2 previous directory

2.  Basic Routing:
    path('', include('core.urls')),                         # home, landing pages
    path('accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),            # start of accounts
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),


    /                    → Home
    /accounts/login/     → Login
    /admin/              → Admin

3.  ADVANTAGE OF USING "RELATED NAME" in models when creating a foreign key
    ***** foreignkey.relatedname.function   *****
        student = Student.objects.get(id=1)
            student.issue_logs.all()

     means:::: Give me all issue log records that belong to this student.

     we can save writing this ==>>  StudentIssueLog.objects.filter(student=student)

    **** Practical usage (REAL examples)   ****
Show student history
logs = request.user.student.issue_logs.all()

Count issued items
student.issue_logs.filter(status_from_teacher="Approved").count()

Check if student already requested a component
student.issue_logs.filter(
    component=component,
    status_from_teacher="Pending"
).exists()

*********************************
FUTURE TO DO'S
*********************************

1. set models k columns ki size for better databse storage

2. load fresh new components

3. admin.site.urls ko env mein daalna

4. database tables mein jaise status hai, category names hai unko integer values dedo vo table mein
rahna   COMPONENT_STATUS = [
        ('Defective', 'Defective'),
        ('Deleted', 'Deleted'),
        ("working", 'working')
    ]
    isme se kisi jagah par 0 ,1, 2, kar sakte hai kya
